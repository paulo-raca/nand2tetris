Nand 2 Tetris
=============

These are my projects for the [Nand2Tetris](http://www.nand2tetris.org/) course, which I've been taking at [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/course/nand2tetris1).

During the course I got to build all the parts of a complete (emulated) computer called "Hack":
- [Basic logic gates](01)
- [Basic arithmetic gates](02)
- [Memory cells](03)
- [CPU and complete computer](05)
- [A few programs in Hack Assembly](04)
- [Hack Assembler](06)
